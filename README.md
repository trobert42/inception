## What is Docker ?
Docker is a virtualization tool that packages and deploys applications along with their dependencies into a software container. These containers are isolated from one another and can run on any machine running Docker software, greatly simplifying application deployment and distribution.

- Portability: Applications can be easily deployed across different operating systems.
- Isolation: Docker containers are isolated from each other, ensuring that each application operates independently without affecting others.
- Automation: Scripts can be used to automate the deployment and maintenance of applications.
